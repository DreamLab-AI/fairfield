# Mobile App

Install the app on your phone for the best mobile experience.

---

## Overview

The platform works as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — a website that behaves like a native app. You get:

- **Home screen icon** — Launch like any other app
- **Full screen** — No browser address bar
- **Offline support** — Read recent messages without internet
- **Push notifications** — Stay informed on the go
- **Fast performance** — Optimised for mobile devices

---

## Installing on iPhone

### Steps

1. Open **Safari** on your iPhone
2. Navigate to the platform website
3. Tap the **Share** button (square with arrow)
4. Scroll down and tap **Add to Home Screen**
5. Give it a name (or keep the default)
6. Tap **Add**

### Important Notes

- **Must use Safari** — This doesn't work in Chrome or other browsers on iOS
- The app icon appears on your home screen
- Tap it to launch in full-screen mode

---

## Installing on Android

### Using Chrome

1. Open **Chrome** on your Android device
2. Navigate to the platform website
3. Tap the **menu** (three dots)
4. Tap **Add to Home screen** or **Install app**
5. Confirm the installation
6. The app appears in your app drawer and home screen

### Using Other Browsers

Most modern Android browsers support PWA installation. Look for:
- "Install" banner at the bottom of the page
- "Add to Home screen" in the menu
- Install prompt that appears automatically

## Performance Tips

### For Best Experience

✅ **Do:**
- Keep the app updated (refresh occasionally)
- Clear cached data if experiencing issues
- Use Wi-Fi for initial setup
- Allow background refresh

❌ **Avoid:**
- Force-closing the app frequently
- Using in extremely low-signal areas for sending
- Having dozens of tabs open

### Data Usage

The app is designed to be data-efficient:
- Images load progressively
- Content caches locally
- Updates are incremental
