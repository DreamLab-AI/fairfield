# Bookmarks

Save important messages for quick access later.

---

## What Are Bookmarks?

Bookmarks are your personal collection of saved messages. Use them to:

- **Remember** important information
- **Track** action items and decisions
- **Reference** useful content quickly
- **Organise** things you want to revisit

Your bookmarks are **private** — only you can see what you've saved.

1. Hover over the message you want to save
2. Click the **bookmark** icon (🔖)
3. The message is saved to your bookmarks

### Visual Confirmation

## Bookmark Tips

### What to Bookmark

✅ **Good for bookmarking:**
- Important announcements
- Meeting times and locations
- Action items assigned to you
- Useful resources and links
- Answers to common questions
- Reference information

❌ **Less useful to bookmark:**
- Casual conversation
- Temporary information
- Content you've already acted on

### Keeping Bookmarks Useful

Review your bookmarks periodically:
- Remove outdated items
- Follow up on action items
- Transfer important info to other notes if needed

## Bookmarks vs Pins

| Bookmarks | Pins |
|-----------|------|
| Personal — only you see them | Public — everyone in channel sees them |
| Save any message you can see | Only admins can pin |
| For your own reference | For channel-wide important info |
| Unlimited | Limited per channel |

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>I can't find the bookmark icon</strong></summary>

The bookmark icon appears when you hover over a message. Make sure you're:
- Hovering over the message
- Looking at the action icons that appear
- Using a supported browser

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>My bookmark disappeared</strong></summary>

Possible reasons:
- The original message was deleted
- You accidentally removed the bookmark
- The channel was deleted or you lost access

Bookmarks are tied to the original message — if it's deleted, the bookmark goes too.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I export my bookmarks?</strong></summary>

Currently, bookmarks stay within the platform. For important information you need elsewhere, copy the content manually.

## Privacy

- **Your bookmarks are private** — no one else can see them
- **Channel rules still apply** — you can only bookmark messages you can view
- **Deleted messages** — if the original is deleted, the bookmark is removed
