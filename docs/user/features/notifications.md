# Notifications

Stay informed about activity that matters to you.

---

## How Notifications Work

Notifications alert you to activity:
- **In-app** — Badge counts and notification panel
- **Push** — Alerts on your device (mobile/desktop)
- **Email** — Summary digests (optional)

---

## Types of Notifications

### High Priority

These are on by default:

| Type | When You're Notified |
|------|---------------------|
| **Direct mention** | Someone @mentions you |
| **Private message** | You receive a DM |
| **Reply** | Someone replies to your message |

### Medium Priority

| Type | When You're Notified |
|------|---------------------|
| **Event reminder** | An event you're attending is approaching |
| **Event update** | Details change for an event you're attending |
| **Channel mention** | @everyone or @here in a channel |

### Low Priority

| Type | When You're Notified |
|------|---------------------|
| **New member** | Someone joins a zone |
| **Channel activity** | New messages in watched channels |
| **Weekly digest** | Summary of activity |

---

## Managing Notifications

### Global Settings

| **Push notifications** | On / Off |
| **Sound** | On / Off |
| **Quiet hours** | Set times when notifications are silenced |
| **Email digest** | Daily / Weekly / Off |

### Per-Channel Settings

For each channel, you can set:

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **All activity** | Every new message |
| **Mentions only** | @mentions and replies |
| **Nothing** | Muted completely |

To change:

2. Click the channel header
3. Select **Notification settings**
4. Choose your preference

### Muting Channels

2. Select **Mute**
3. Choose duration: 1 hour, 8 hours, 24 hours, or Until I unmute

---

## Desktop Notifications

### Enabling Desktop Notifications

When using the web browser:
1. Your browser asks for permission
2. Click **Allow**
3. Notifications appear even when the tab isn't active

### Managing Browser Permissions

If you blocked notifications by accident:
1. Click the lock/info icon in your browser's address bar
2. Find **Notifications**
3. Change to **Allow**
4. Refresh the page

---

## Mobile Notifications

### Setup

When you install the mobile app:
1. Allow notifications when prompted
2. Configure in **Settings > Notifications**
3. Adjust phone settings if needed

### Phone Settings

Also check your phone's settings:
- **iOS**: Settings > [App name] > Notifications
- **Android**: Settings > Apps > [App name] > Notifications

---

## Quiet Hours

### What It Does

During quiet hours:
- No sounds or vibrations
- No pop-up notifications
- Badge counts still update
- You can still open the app and see everything

### Setting Quiet Hours

1. Go to **Settings > Notifications**
2. Enable **Quiet Hours**
3. Set start and end times
4. Optionally enable different times for weekends

### Override

For truly urgent items (if enabled by zone administrators), some notifications can bypass quiet hours.

## Notification Best Practices

### Avoiding Notification Fatigue

✅ **Do:**
- Mute busy channels you don't need real-time updates from
- Use "Mentions only" for high-traffic channels
- Set quiet hours for personal time
- Review settings periodically

❌ **Don't:**
- Leave all channels at "All activity"
- Disable all notifications (you'll miss important things)
- Ignore notification permissions setup

### Staying Informed Without Overwhelm

| Channel Type | Recommended Setting |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Important announcements | All activity |
| Project discussions | Mentions only |
| Social/casual chat | Muted or off |
| Events | All activity |

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Not receiving any notifications</strong></summary>

Check these in order:
1. In-app: Settings > Notifications > enabled?
2. Browser: Permissions allowed for this site?
3. Phone: App notifications enabled in system settings?
4. Do Not Disturb: Disabled or app excepted?
5. Quiet Hours: Not currently active?

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Too many notifications</strong></summary>

Reduce the noise:
1. Mute channels you don't need real-time alerts from
2. Set busy channels to "Mentions only"
3. Enable quiet hours during focus time
4. Review each channel's notification setting

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Notifications delayed</strong></summary>

Possible causes:
- **Battery optimisation** — Check phone isn't restricting the app
- **Connection issues** — Notifications need internet
- **Server processing** — Very rare delays during high traffic

On Android, check Settings > Apps > [App name] > Battery > Unrestricted.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Sound not working</strong></summary>

Check:
1. Phone not on silent/vibrate
2. App sound setting enabled
3. Browser permission includes sound
4. System volume not muted

</details>

- **Private messages** — DM notifications are private to you
