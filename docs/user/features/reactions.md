- **Vote** informally
- **Celebrate** good news

---

2. Click the **emoji icon** that appears
3. Select an emoji from the picker
4. Your reaction is added

### Keyboard Shortcut

Some frequently used reactions have shortcuts:

## Reaction Etiquette

### When to Use Reactions

✅ **Good uses:**
- Quick acknowledgement
- Expressing agreement
- Celebrating announcements
- Informal polling
- Reducing message clutter

❌ **Less appropriate:**
- When a reply is needed
- Passive-aggressive responses
- Reaction spam
- Important feedback (use words instead)

### Reactions vs Replies

| Use Reactions When | Use Replies When |
|--------------------|------------------|
| A simple acknowledgement is enough | You have something to add |
| Many people feel the same | Your response is unique |
| You don't want to notify everyone | The person needs to see your response |
| It's casual/social | It's important/actionable |

---

## Reactions as Informal Polls

Some communities use reactions for quick polls:

**Example:**
> "Should we meet Saturday or Sunday?"
>
> React 🅰️ for Saturday, 🅱️ for Sunday

This works well for:
- Quick decisions
- Gathering preferences
- Simple yes/no questions

---

## Custom Emoji

Some zones may have custom emoji available:
- Zone-specific images
- Inside jokes
- Branded icons

Look for these in the emoji picker under a custom section.

---

## Accessibility

### Screen Readers

Reactions are announced with:
- The emoji name
- The count
- Who reacted (when expanded)

### Keyboard Access

Navigate to reactions using Tab and activate with Enter.

---

## Privacy

- **Reactions are public** — Everyone who can see the message can see reactions
- **Your identity is visible** — Others can see that you reacted
- **Think before reacting** — It's associated with your profile
