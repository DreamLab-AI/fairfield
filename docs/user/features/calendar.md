## Cross-Zone Calendar

If you're in multiple zones:

### What You See

- Your personal calendar shows events from all your zones
- Events are colour-coded or labelled by zone
- You can filter to show only certain zones

### Privacy

- Event details stay within their zone
- You can see your own events across zones
- Others only see events in zones they belong to
