# Messaging

Learn how to send and receive messages in channels.

---

## Channel Messaging Basics

Channels are shared spaces where zone members can communicate. When you post in a channel, all members of that zone can see your message.

---

## Sending Messages

### Write Your Message

1. Select a channel from the sidebar
2. Click in the message input at the bottom of the screen
3. Type your message
4. Press **Enter** or click **Send**

### Message Formatting

You can format your messages using simple syntax:

| What You Type | What You Get |
|---------------|--------------|
| `**bold text**` | **bold text** |
| `*italic text*` | *italic text* |
| `~~strikethrough~~` | ~~strikethrough~~ |
| `` `code` `` | `code` |
| `> quote` | Quoted text |

### Multi-line Messages

To write a message that spans multiple lines:
- Press **Shift + Enter** to create a new line
- Continue typing
- Press **Enter** when ready to send

### Mentioning People

To notify someone specifically:
1. Type `@` followed by their name
2. Select from the suggestions that appear
3. They'll receive a notification when you send

Example: `Hey @Alice, are you coming to the event?`

---

## Replying to Messages

### Threaded Replies

To reply directly to a specific message:

1. Hover over the message you want to reply to
2. Click the **Reply** icon
3. Type your response
4. Send

Threaded replies keep conversations organised by grouping related messages together.

### When to Use Replies

✅ **Use replies when:**
- Responding to a specific question
- Continuing a sub-conversation
- Your message only makes sense in context

❌ **Post normally when:**
- Starting a new topic
- Addressing the whole channel
- The message stands alone

---

## Reactions

React to messages without adding to the conversation:

### Adding Reactions

1. Hover over a message
2. Click the **emoji picker** icon
3. Select an emoji
4. Your reaction is added

### Removing Reactions

Click your existing reaction to remove it.

### Common Reactions

| Emoji | Typical Meaning |
|-------|-----------------|
| 👍 | Agree, approve, acknowledge |
| ❤️ | Love, appreciate |
| 😂 | Funny |
| 🎉 | Celebrate |
| 👀 | I've seen this / looking into it |
| ✅ | Done / confirmed |

---

## Managing Your Messages

### Editing Messages

To edit a message you've sent:

1. Hover over your message
2. Click the **menu** (⋯) icon
3. Select **Edit**
4. Make your changes
5. Press Enter to save

Edited messages show an "edited" indicator.

### Deleting Messages

To delete a message you've sent:

1. Hover over your message
2. Click the **menu** (⋯) icon
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm deletion

Once deleted, the message is removed from the channel.

---

## Finding Messages

### Scrolling History

- Scroll up to see older messages
- Messages load automatically as you scroll

### Search

To find specific messages:

1. Click the **search** icon (🔍) in the header
2. Type your search terms
3. Filter by channel, person, or date if needed
4. Click a result to jump to that message

See [Searching](searching.md) for detailed search features.

---

## Bookmarking Messages

Save important messages for later:

1. Hover over a message
2. Click the **bookmark** icon
3. The message is saved to your bookmarks

Access bookmarks from the main menu.

---

## Pinned Messages

Channels can have pinned messages that stay accessible:

### Viewing Pins

1. Look for the **pin icon** in the channel header
2. Click to see all pinned messages

### Who Can Pin

Channel administrators can pin important messages for everyone to see.

---

## Message Etiquette

### Good Practices

✅ Stay on topic for the channel
✅ Use appropriate channels for different discussions
✅ Keep messages concise
✅ Use formatting to improve readability
✅ React instead of posting "me too" messages

### Things to Avoid

❌ Cross-posting the same message to multiple channels
❌ Using ALL CAPS (reads as shouting)
❌ Posting long messages without formatting
❌ Sending multiple short messages in quick succession (combine into one)

---

## Notifications

### When You're Notified

By default, you receive notifications for:
- Direct mentions (@yourname)
- Replies to your messages
- Activity in channels you've marked as priority

### Managing Notifications

See [Notifications](notifications.md) to customise what notifications you receive.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>My message won't send</strong></summary>

Check these things:
- Are you connected to the internet?
- Is the platform showing offline status?
- Is the message very long? Try shortening it.

If offline, messages are queued and send when you reconnect.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I can't see new messages</strong></summary>

Try these steps:
1. Scroll to the bottom of the channel
2. Check if you have the channel open (not another one)
3. Refresh the page
4. Check your internet connection

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>My formatting isn't working</strong></summary>

Make sure you're using the correct syntax:
- Asterisks must touch the text: `**bold**` not `** bold **`
- Don't mix formatting types incorrectly
- Some formatting doesn't work in certain contexts

</details>
