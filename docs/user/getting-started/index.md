# Getting Started

Welcome! This guide will help you set up your account and start using the platform.

---

## Quick Start

1. **[Create Your Account](creating-account.md)** — Set up your secure identity (5 minutes)
2. **[First Steps](first-steps.md)** — Learn the basics of navigation (10 minutes)
3. **[Explore Your Zone](../zones/index.md)** — Learn about community spaces (5 minutes)

---

## What You'll Need

Before you begin:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- An email address (for account recovery only—not required for login)
- A secure place to store your recovery phrase (password manager recommended)

---

## How the Platform Works

### Your Identity

Unlike traditional platforms, your identity here is based on cryptographic keys:

- **No email/password login** — You sign in with a unique key
- **Recovery phrase** — A 12-word phrase that can restore your account
- **True ownership** — Your identity belongs to you, not the platform

### Zones

The platform has three community zones:

| Zone | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Minimoonoir** | UK social events and community |
| **DreamLab** | Creative technology and business |
| **Family** | Private family coordination |

You may have access to one or more zones depending on your membership.

### Privacy

Your communications are protected:

- **Channel messages** — Visible to zone members
- **Private messages** — Encrypted, visible only to you and the recipient
- **Zone separation** — Each zone is completely private from others
