# Creating Your Account

This guide walks you through creating your secure account on the platform.

---

## Before You Begin

**Important:** This platform uses a different login system than most websites. Instead of an email and password, you'll have a **recovery phrase** — 12 or 24 words that can restore your account.

You will need:
- A secure place to store your recovery phrase (password manager recommended)
- 5-10 minutes of uninterrupted time

---

## Step 1: Visit the Platform

Open the platform in your web browser. You'll see the welcome screen.

Click **Create Account** or **Sign Up**.

---

## Step 2: Generate Your Identity

The platform will create a unique cryptographic identity for you. This happens entirely in your browser—your private keys never leave your device.

You'll see a screen with your **recovery phrase** — 12 or 24 words in a specific order.

```
Example recovery phrase (do not use this):
───────────────────────────────────────────
abandon  ability  able     about
above    absent   absorb   abstract
absurd   abuse    access   accident
───────────────────────────────────────────
```

---

## Step 3: Save Your Recovery Phrase

⚠️ **This is the most important step.**

Your recovery phrase is the **only** way to recover your account. If you lose it, your account cannot be recovered. No one can help you—not even platform administrators.

### How to Save Your Phrase

**Recommended: Use a password manager**
1. Create a new entry in your password manager
2. Store the complete phrase in the notes field
3. Save the entry

**Alternative: Write it down**
1. Write the words clearly on paper
2. Include the number order (word 1, word 2, etc.)
3. Store in a secure location (safe, lockbox)
4. Consider making a backup copy in a different secure location

### What NOT to Do

❌ Don't take a screenshot (could be backed up to cloud)
❌ Don't email it to yourself (not secure)
❌ Don't store it in a plain text file
❌ Don't share it with anyone
❌ Don't skip this step thinking you'll do it later

---

## Step 4: Confirm You've Saved It

The platform will ask you to confirm that you've saved your recovery phrase. This usually involves:

- Acknowledging that you understand the importance
- Selecting specific words from your phrase in order
- Confirming you have a secure backup

Take this seriously—it's for your protection.

## Step 5: Set Up Your Profile

Once your account is created, you can customise your profile:

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Display Name | How others will see you | Recommended |
| Profile Picture | Your avatar | Optional |
| About | A short bio | Optional |

You can update these anytime in your profile settings.

---

## Step 6: Join a Zone

Your account may already have access to zones, or you may need to request access:

- **Pre-approved access** — You'll see available zones immediately
- **Request needed** — Contact a zone administrator or existing member

---

## You're Ready!

Your account is now set up. Here's what to do next:

1. **[Take your first steps](first-steps.md)** - Learn to navigate the platform
2. **[Explore your zone](../zones/index.md)** - See what your community offers
3. **[Install the mobile app](../features/mobile-app.md)** - Take the platform with you

---

## Signing In Later

When you return to the platform:

### On the Same Device

If you're using the same browser on the same device, you'll likely be signed in automatically. The platform stores your keys securely in your browser.

### On a New Device

To sign in on a new device, you'll need your recovery phrase:

1. Click **Sign In** or **Recover Account**
2. Enter your 12 or 24 word recovery phrase
3. Your account will be restored

### If You Cleared Browser Data

If you've cleared your browser data or cookies, treat it like a new device—use your recovery phrase to restore access.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>I didn't save my recovery phrase</strong></summary>

If you're still logged in:
1. Go to your profile settings
2. Look for "Backup" or "Recovery Phrase"
3. Your phrase will be displayed—save it now

If you're logged out and didn't save it, the account cannot be recovered. You'll need to create a new account.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>My recovery phrase isn't working</strong></summary>

Check these common issues:
- **Word order** — Words must be in the exact order
- **Spelling** — Check for typos (all words are from a specific list)
- **Extra spaces** — Make sure there are no extra spaces
- **Word count** — Confirm you have all 12 or 24 words

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I want to change my recovery phrase</strong></summary>

Your recovery phrase is tied to your identity and cannot be changed. If you're concerned it may have been compromised, create a new account with a new phrase.
