# Reporting & Blocking

Handle unwanted behaviour and keep your experience positive.

---

## Blocking Users

### When to Block

Block someone if they:
- Send unwanted messages
- Harass or bully you
- Make you uncomfortable
- Spam or send inappropriate content
- Impersonate someone else

You don't need to justify blocking someone — your comfort matters.

### How to Block

**From a message:**
1. Click on their profile picture or name
2. Click the **menu** (⋯)
3. Select **Block**
4. Confirm

**From their profile:**
1. Open their profile
2. Click the **menu** (⋯)
3. Select **Block**
4. Confirm

**From private messages:**
1. Open the conversation
2. Click the **menu** (⋯)
3. Select **Block**
4. Confirm

### What Blocking Does

| Effect | Blocked User |
|--------|--------------|
| Send you DMs | ❌ Cannot |
| See your online status | ❌ Cannot |
| Find you in search | ❌ Cannot |
| See your profile | Limited |
| Post in same channels | ✅ Can (but you won't see their messages) |

### What Blocking Doesn't Do

- The blocked user isn't notified
- They can still see public content in shared zones
- Administrators aren't automatically informed
- It doesn't remove their existing messages from channels

---

## Unblocking Users

### How to Unblock

1. Go to **Settings > Blocked Users**
2. Find the user in your blocked list
3. Click **Unblock**
4. Confirm

### After Unblocking

- They can message you again
- You'll see their messages in channels
- Your previous conversation history may still exist

---

## Reporting to Administrators

### When to Report

Report behaviour that:
- Violates zone rules
- Threatens or harasses members
- Spreads harmful content
- Involves impersonation
- Affects the wider community

### How to Report

**From a message:**
1. Click the **menu** (⋯) on the message
2. Select **Report**
3. Choose a reason
4. Add details (optional but helpful)
5. Submit

**From a profile:**
1. Open the user's profile
2. Click the **menu** (⋯)
3. Select **Report**
4. Choose a reason and add details
5. Submit

### What to Include in Reports

Helpful information:
- What happened
- When it occurred
- Any context administrators should know
- Screenshots (if you have them)
- Other users involved

### What Happens After Reporting

1. Zone administrators receive your report
2. They review the content and context
3. They may contact you for more information
4. They take appropriate action based on zone rules
5. You may or may not be informed of the outcome

## Report Categories

When reporting, you'll typically choose from:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Harassment** | Bullying, targeted abuse, unwanted contact |
| **Spam** | Repeated unwanted messages, advertising |
| **Inappropriate Content** | Content that violates zone guidelines |
| **Impersonation** | Pretending to be someone else |
| **Threats** | Violence, harm, intimidation |
| **Misinformation** | Deliberately false information |
| **Other** | Anything not covered above |

## Muting vs Blocking

| Feature | Muting | Blocking |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Stop notifications | ✅ | ✅ |
| Hide their messages | ❌ | ✅ |
| Stop their DMs | ❌ | ✅ |
| They know | ❌ | ❌ |
| Reversible | ✅ | ✅ |

**Muting** is for reducing noise from someone you don't mind seeing occasionally.
**Blocking** is for people you want completely removed from your experience.

## Leaving a Zone

If a zone becomes problematic:

### How to Leave

1. Open the zone
2. Go to **Settings** or zone menu
3. Select **Leave Zone**
4. Confirm

### Before Leaving

Consider:
- Saving any important information
- Saying goodbye if appropriate
- Whether the issue can be resolved with administrators

### After Leaving

- You lose access to zone content
- Your messages remain (unless deleted before leaving)
- You can rejoin if it's an open zone (invitation may be needed for private zones)

Contact platform support or administrators.

## Your Role in Community Safety

### Positive Contributions

Help keep zones safe:
- Report genuine issues (don't abuse the system)

### What Not to Do

Avoid:

- Vigilante justice
- Public call-outs (report privately instead)
- Escalating conflicts
- Sharing details of ongoing investigations

## Privacy of Reports

### Your Identity

When you report:
- Administrators see who reported
- The reported person **does not** see who reported
- Your report is confidential

### Investigation Details

- You may not learn the outcome
- Administrators can't always share details
- Privacy of all parties is considered

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I report anonymously?</strong></summary>

Administrators can see who submitted reports, but the reported person cannot. If you're concerned about retaliation, mention this in your report.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if the administrator is the problem?</strong></summary>

If zone administrators are problematic:
- Report to other administrators in the zone
- Contact platform-level support if available
- Leave the zone if necessary
- Warn others privately if appropriate

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How long does it take to address reports?</strong></summary>

This varies:
- Urgent safety issues: as soon as possible
- General reports: within a few days
- Complex situations: may take longer

Volunteer administrators have varying availability.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I accidentally blocked someone?</strong></summary>

Go to Settings > Blocked Users and unblock them. No harm done — they weren't notified.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I see messages from someone I blocked if I unblock them?</strong></summary>

You may see their new messages after unblocking. Messages sent while blocked may or may not be visible depending on the platform's implementation.
