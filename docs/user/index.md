## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I join a specific zone?</strong></summary>

Zones require an invitation from an existing member or administrator. Each zone has its own access requirements based on the community it serves.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I be part of multiple zones?</strong></summary>

Yes! Your single account can have access to multiple zones. Each zone appears in your navigation, and you can switch between them freely.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are my private messages really private?</strong></summary>

Yes. Private messages use end-to-end encryption with a technique called "gift wrapping" that hides not just the content, but also when the message was sent and who sent it. Even platform administrators cannot read your private conversations.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if I lose my recovery phrase?</strong></summary>

Your recovery phrase is the only way to recover your account. Without it, your account cannot be recovered. We recommend storing it in a secure location, such as a password manager.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use the platform offline?</strong></summary>

Yes! The platform works as a Progressive Web App (PWA). Once installed, you can read previously loaded messages offline. New messages you compose will be queued and sent automatically when you're back online.
