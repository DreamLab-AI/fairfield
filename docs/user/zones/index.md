# Community Zones

The platform is organised into three distinct zones, each serving a specific community with its own purpose, culture, and features.

---

## What Are Zones?

Zones are separate community spaces within the platform. Each zone:

- Has its own channels and discussions
- Serves a specific community purpose
- Has its own membership and access controls
- Maintains privacy from other zones

Think of zones like separate buildings in a complex—each has its own rooms and purposes, but they share common infrastructure.

## Zone Independence

Each zone is independent:

| Aspect | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Membership** | You can be a member of one, two, or all three zones |
| **Privacy** | Content in one zone is invisible to members of other zones |
| **Channels** | Each zone has its own set of channels |
| **Calendar** | Events are zone-specific, but you can see your personal calendar across zones |

---

## Switching Between Zones

If you're a member of multiple zones:

1. Look for the **zone selector** in the navigation
2. Click to switch between zones
3. Each zone remembers where you left off

Your notifications work across all zones you're part of.

---

## Zone-Specific Features

While all zones share core functionality, each has features tailored to its purpose:

| Feature | Minimoonoir | DreamLab | Family |
|---------|:-----------:|:--------:|:------:|
| Event Planning | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Project Channels | — | ✓ | — |
| Property Tracking | — | — | ✓ |
| Regional Groups | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Business Tools | — | ✓ | — |
| Family Calendar | — | — | ✓ |

---

## Privacy Between Zones

**Important:** Zones are completely separate for privacy:

- A Minimoonoir member cannot see DreamLab content (unless they're also a DreamLab member)
- Family content is only visible to Family zone members
- Your username and profile can be different in each zone if you choose
- Private messages are separate and encrypted regardless of zone

---

## Joining a Zone

Each zone has its own access requirements:

- **Minimoonoir** — Invitation from existing member or administrator approval
- **DreamLab** — Based on relationship with the business or community
- **Family** — Limited to family members only

Contact the relevant community if you believe you should have access.
